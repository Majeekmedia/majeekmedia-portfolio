## What's Next 🚀

### Projects Section - Needs Your Input!

Currently showing a placeholder project card. To populate with real projects, I
need:

**For Each Project:**

1. Project name
2. Project type (e.g., "E-commerce Website", "Crypto Platform")
3. One-sentence description
4. Tech stack tags (e.g., React, Supabase, Node.js)
5. Primary thumbnail screenshot (aspect ratio 16:9 works best)
6. Optional: Demo URL

**Example Format:**

```
Name: Village Headmaster
Type: E-commerce Platform
Description: Cross-border multi-vendor marketplace connecting vendors with global buyers
Tech: React, Supabase, Tailwind CSS, Stripe
Thumbnail: /projects/vhm/thumbnail.jpg
Demo: https://vhm-demo.netlify.app
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` and you should now see:

- Black hero with your image
- **White "About Me" section**
- **White skills section** with 4 category cards

Perfect alternation between black and white sections, just like the reference!
